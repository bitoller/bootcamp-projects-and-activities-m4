# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `fourth module`, or `M4` for short.<br />

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M4` means `Module 4`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

## S1-18-M4 - 05/29/23 - MERCADO AUTÔNOMO
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for an inventory management system for an imaginary startup undergoing testing, using Node.js, TypeScript and Express, with the aim of transforming into a network of autonomous markets called Smart Store. Currently, the market deals with two types of products: food and cleaning supplies. To effectively manage the market's inventory, the application will include routes for creating, listing, updating, and deleting products.<br />
