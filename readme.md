# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `fourth module`, or `M4` for short.<br />

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M4` means `Module 4`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

## S1-18-M4 - 05/29/23 - MERCADO AUTÔNOMO
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for an inventory management system for an imaginary startup undergoing testing, using Node.js, TypeScript and Express, with the aim of transforming into a network of autonomous markets called Smart Store. Currently, the market deals with two types of products: food and cleaning supplies. To effectively manage the market's inventory, the application will include routes for creating, listing, updating, and deleting products.<br />

## S2-20-M4 - 06/05/23 - LOCADORA DE FILMES
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for a fake client who manages a movie rental store, using Node.js, TypeScript, Express and PostgreSQL. The purpose of this API is to be integrated into a streaming platform and facilitate the management of their movie collection. To effectively manage the store's inventory, the application will include routes for creating, listing, updating, and deleting movies.<br />

## S3-15-M4 - 06/12/23 - KENZIEVELOPERS
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for a fake client so they can manage their developers and projects, using Node.js, TypeScript, Express and PostgreSQL. The purpose of this API is to register developers, associate additional information with them, and record the projects of each developer. The application will include routes for creating, listing, updating, and deleting developers, developer's infos and projects.<br />

## S4-10-M4 - 06/19/23 - USER E COURSES + PERMISSÃO DE ADMINISTRADOR
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for a fake client so they can manage their users and courses, using Node.js, TypeScript, Express and PostgreSQL. The purpose of this API is to register users and record the courses of each user. The application will include routes for creating, listing and deleting users and courses. In addition to core functionality, I implemented robust access control measures within the API. This allowed users to access specific resources only after successful login, while users with administrative permissions enjoyed extended privileges and control over the system.<br />
